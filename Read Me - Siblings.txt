## 1. Demographics (Demographics.R)

# This is the main file containing all demographics data, incorporating some data from the demographics questionnaires at 6 and 18 months,
# mothers' PVT scores, and CDI data (productive vocabulary) from 6-18 months.

# This is the first script to be generated in the siblings analysis markdown file; it generates the *SiblingsData* dataframe used in the main analysis. 

# *SiblingsData* includes the following variables:

1. subj          
2. month            
3. sex              
4. MOTedulevel           
5. age_mom      
6. PVTscore
7. SibsYN
8. Siblings6 
9. Siblings18 
10. SibGroup6 
11. SibGroup18 
12. Total.words 
13. Log.Totalwords 
14. tokens_video 
15. types_video 
16. tokens_audio 
17. types_audio 
18. Log.tokens_video 
19. Log.types_video 
20. Log.tokens_audio 
21. Log.types_audio


# 2. Data gathering (Data gathering.R)

# This file extracts the relevant data from the basiclevels spreadsheet (all_basiclevel_randsubj.csv).

# Three main variables are extracted and joined with the Demographics spreadsheet: object presence, utterance type, and speaker type.

# This script creates the two input variables for the analysis:

# i) speaker.type: how much input does the infant get from mother/father/siblings during the recording, and how much from TV/toys? Coded as n and %.
# ii) object.presence: how many/what proportion of input words match an object in the infant's environment?

## Data files saved in folder:

# demo_deid_cleaned.csv - demographics data for all SEEDLingS participants

# ParentPVT - PVT scores and ages for all SEEDLingS mothers

# CDI - CDI data of all participants

# SiblingsAges.csv - includes age of siblings, sibling group, and whether the sibling is older or younger
